# Snake Game in C++ — Windows Learning Project

Welcome! This project will guide you through building a **Snake game** from scratch using **C++** and **SFML 3** on **Windows**.

By the end, you'll have a fully playable game — and along the way you'll learn:

- C++ basics: variables, loops, functions, classes
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- How GUIs and game loops work
- How to structure a real software project

## Where to Start

**Read the docs folder in order**, starting with `STEP_01_setup.md`.

Each file tells you exactly what to do next, explains *why* you're doing it, and gives you hints — but you write the code yourself.

---

## Requirements (Windows only)

- Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit)
- [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) — provides the compiler, CMake, and SFML all in one place
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) — recommended code editor
- [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

Full installation instructions are in **STEP_01_setup.md**.

---

## Quick Build (after setup is complete)

Open the **MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit** terminal, navigate to this folder, then run:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"
mingw32-make
```

Or just double-click **`build.bat`** in File Explorer.

The game executable will appear at `build\snake.exe`.

---

## SFML Version

This project uses **SFML 3**. If you have SFML 2 installed, the build will fail with a version mismatch error. Re-run the `pacman` install command in STEP_01 to get SFML 3.

---

## Tips

- **Don't rush.** Read each step fully before writing any code.
- **Type the code yourself** — don't copy/paste. Muscle memory matters.
- **If something breaks**, that's normal! Read the error message carefully. It's usually telling you exactly what's wrong.
- Use `git commit` after each step so you can go back if something breaks.
- Always use the **MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit** terminal, not PowerShell or Command Prompt, for building.

Good luck, and have fun!
